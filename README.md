Overview: 
  *  Implementing master detail flow activity 
 * Note that this activity can be used for our group project ( individual exercise card list view) 
Version A: 
The main activity contains a list of items and each item is clickable 
After clicking each item, a detail information regarding this item will be prompted up. 
Version B: 
After clicking items, instead of showing text of information, we are opening an webview thatâ€™s visiting "https://www.google.com"
